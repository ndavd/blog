### Technical overview

The ENS name `ndavd.eth` resolves to an IPNS record that is updated to reflect
the latest deployment CIDv0 of this repository, which you can always find in the
[`cid.txt`](https://github.com/ndavd/blog/blob/main/cid.txt) file (or in the
blog's footer).

You can find a deep-dive into this architecture and IPFS itself in my first
blogpost: https://ndavd.eth.limo/hello-world.
